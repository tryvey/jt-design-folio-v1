# Apple Vision Pro Solution Research  

**Project:** Water Infrastructure Applications
**Client:** Melbourne Water
**Partner:** Telstra Purple
**Role:** Managing UX Design Consultant

Spatial computing experience prototyping, exploring new interaction paradigms and immersive user journeys.

### 🧭 Context

Melbourne Water oversees Victoria’s essential waterways and infrastructure. Their field teams face challenges with real-time monitoring, environmental reporting, and infrastructure maintenance—especially in remote or high-risk areas. We explored how Apple Vision Pro could enhance operations through immersive AR experiences.

---

### 🏁 Outcome

We designed and demonstrated Vision Pro use cases tailored to Melbourne Water’s needs—unlocking potential in inspections, monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and team collaboration. Our spatial UX concepts illustrated how AR and live data overlays could improve response times, accuracy, and public trust.

## 🔧 Key Stages

### 🏞️ 1. Monitoring Waterway Health  
**Tech:** Real-time data overlays · 3D hydrological models · Sensor integration  

- Visualise pH, turbidity, and contaminant data on-location  
- Map ecosystem health in AR, with species health indicators  
- View sediment or flow patterns over physical landscapes  

💡 *Example:* A technician sees live water quality metrics on the river in front of them, with alerts for contamination hotspots.

---

### 🏗️ 2. Infrastructure Inspection & Maintenance  
**Tech:** AR-guided inspections · Drone sync · Spatial repair walkthroughs  

- Highlight risk zones using drone or IoT scan data  
- Provide step-by-step visual repair instructions in AR  
- Enable remote experts to annotate the environment in real time  

💡 *Example:* Dam inspectors walk the site, with stress cracks and valve wear highlighted on their Vision Pro headset.

---

### 🌊 3. Flood Preparedness & Simulation  
**Tech:** Predictive modelling · Team simulations · Emergency AR drills  

- Simulate flood zones, levee breaches or dam failures  
- Run immersive emergency response training for teams  
- Model stress scenarios on aging infrastructure  

💡 *Example:* Emergency planners rehearse a dam breach scenario virtually, refining their response strategy in real time.

---

### 📊 4. Stakeholder Engagement  
**Tech:** Interactive 3D reports · Virtual tours · Immersive walkthroughs  

- Communicate restoration progress or risks using visuals  
- Enable public or decision-makers to tour remote sites virtually  
- Show before/after impact of environmental changes  

💡 *Example:* A stakeholder views sedimentation buildup over time using an immersive AR presentation during a community forum.

---

### 🛠️ 5. Field Operations & Workflow Efficiency  
**Tech:** On-site schematics · Drone overlays · Inspection history  

- View asset history, inspection checklists or repair guides  
- Overlay past data on current visuals for quick comparisons  
- Integrate drone feeds with spatial prompts  

💡 *Example:* A field engineer views a live drone feed of a spillway, with historical issues and repair guidance overlaid in AR.

---

### 🌱 6. Environmental Restoration Planning  
**Tech:** Habitat modelling · Erosion tracking · Spatial ecosystem design  

- Model dam removal or wetland creation and its impact  
- Visualise sediment flow changes in the ecosystem  
- Design fish ladders or biodiversity corridors interactively  

💡 *Example:* A restoration planner simulates a wetland expansion to preview its effect on surrounding vegetation and flow.

---

### 🤝 7. Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing  
**Tech:** Shared AR workspaces · Team annotations · Historical overlay archive  

- Collaborate across locations with shared 3D models  
- Record and share AR notes for future teams  
- Enable field teams to coordinate using synced data views  

💡 *Example:* Engineers and ecologists co-review waterflow issues in a shared AR workspace, each adding annotations in real time.

---

## 📈 Learnings

- **Simplicity is key:** Field tools must surface only the most actionable data.  
- **Spatial UX adds clarity:** AR models helped users grasp system complexity quickly.  
- **Collaboration was a standout:** Teams valued the ability to problem-solve together in shared, data-rich environments.  
- **Integration matters:** The most useful concepts synced with existing drone, sensor and GIS data.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Prioritise use cases like dam inspections and ecosystem monitoring  
- Build interactive prototypes for field testing  
- Integrate live sensor and drone feeds into spatial UI  
- Conduct user testing with rangers, engineers, and planners
