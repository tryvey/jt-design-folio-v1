**Summary**  

*This research project focused on the spatial computing experience prototyping, exploring new interaction paradigms and immersive user journeys to transform how Melbourne Water's field teams could interact with critical infrastructure data.*

## Context
---
<br>

Melbourne Water oversees Victoria's essential waterways and infrastructure, managing complex systems that serve millions of people across the region. Their field teams regularly encounter significant challenges when it comes to real-time monitoring, environmental reporting, and infrastructure maintenance, particularly in remote or high-risk areas where traditional tools and interfaces fall short.

We identified an opportunity to explore how Apple Vision Pro's spatial computing capabilities could fundamentally enhance field operations through immersive AR/VR experiences. The project aimed to bridge the gap between complex environmental data and actionable insights for teams working in challenging field conditions.

## Outcome
---
<br>

Our team designed and demonstrated comprehensive Vision Pro use cases specifically tailored to Melbourne Water's operational needs. The spatial UX concepts we highlighted successfully illustrated how AR technology and live data overlays could dramatically improve response times, increase accuracy in field assessments, and strengthen public trust through enhanced transparency and communication.

The research highlighted significant potential across multiple operational areas including infrastructure inspections, environmental monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and cross-team collaboration. Under my guidance, we created compelling demonstrations that showed how spatial computing could transform routine field work into data-rich, intuitive experiences.


## Concepts
---
<br>

#### Monitoring Waterway Health  

![](/images/case-studies/visionpro/AVP1.png)
* Concept of Field Technition using Apple Vision Pro to inspect and monitor waterway health and contaminant information.

We explored spatial interfaces that could visualize critical water quality data like pH levels, turbidity, and contaminant information directly overlaid onto the physical environment. The concept would allow field technicians to see live metrics floating above water surfaces, with contamination hotspots highlighted and ecosystem health indicators mapped in AR. This approach could create unprecedented situational awareness for teams assessing waterway conditions in real time.

#### Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance

* Concept of Field Technition using Apple Vision Pro to inspect dam integrity for  maintenance.

Our proposed AR-guided inspection system would highlight risk zones using drone and IoT sensor data while providing step-by-step visual repair instructions overlaid on physical infrastructure. Remote experts could annotate the environment in real time, potentially enabling senior engineers to guide field teams through complex procedures without being physically present. Dam inspectors would see stress cracks and valve wear automatically highlighted with contextual maintenance protocols.

#### Flood Preparedness and Simulation

* Concept of Field Technition using Apple Vision Pro to inspect flood scenarios, levee breaches.

We conceptualized immersive emergency response training that would allow teams to simulate flood scenarios, levee breaches, and dam failures in virtual environments. Emergency planners could rehearse response strategies through repeated AR drills while modeling stress scenarios on aging infrastructure. This concept aims to help teams understand potential failure points and refine coordination before real-world emergencies occur.

#### Stakeholder Engagement

* Concept of Interactive 3D reports and virtual site tours.

Interactive 3D reports and virtual site tours could transform how Melbourne Water communicates complex technical information to decision-makers and communities. Stakeholders would experience remote locations virtually and view before-and-after visualizations of environmental changes. During community forums, immersive AR presentations could make complex processes like sedimentation buildup immediately understandable, fostering more informed public engagement.

#### Field Operations and Workflow Efficiency

* Concept of field teams having access to asset histories, inspection checklists, and repair guides in the field.

The envisioned system would allow field teams to access asset histories, inspection checklists, and repair guides contextually overlaid on the equipment they're examining. The concept integrates historical data with current visuals for quick comparisons while synchronizing live drone feeds with spatial prompts. Engineers could simultaneously view drone footage, maintenance records, and repair guidance all spatially organized around the physical infrastructure.

#### Environmental Restoration Planning

* Concept of field teams having access to habitat modeling tools.

Proposed habitat modeling tools would allow planners to simulate interventions like dam removals or wetland creation, visualizing their impact on surrounding ecosystems before implementation. The interface concept enables interactive design of fish ladders and biodiversity corridors while modeling sediment flow changes. Restoration planners could preview how wetland expansions would affect surrounding vegetation and water flow patterns.

#### Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing  

![](/images/case-studies/visionpro/AVP7.png)
* Concept of field teams having access shared AR workspaces that would enable teams to collaborate in synchronized 3D environments.

We conceptualized shared AR workspaces that would enable distributed teams to collaborate in synchronized 3D environments, adding annotations and sharing insights in real time regardless of physical location. The proposed system would archive AR notes for future reference, building institutional knowledge across personnel changes. Engineers and ecologists could co-review complex issues in shared environments, each contributing expertise through spatial annotations.

## Learnings
---
<br>

Throughout this project, several key insights emerged that shaped our approach and recommendations. Simplicity proved absolutely critical in field environments where teams need immediate access to actionable information without cognitive overhead. Our spatial UX approach consistently demonstrated superior clarity compared to traditional interfaces, helping users quickly grasp system complexity that would otherwise require extensive training or experience.

Collaboration capabilities consistently received the strongest positive feedback from Melbourne Water teams. The ability to problem-solve together in shared, data-rich environments transformed how distributed teams approach complex challenges. Integration with existing systems proved essential, with the most valuable concepts being those that seamlessly incorporated drone feeds, sensor networks, and GIS databases that teams already rely on.

We also learned that successful spatial computing implementations require careful attention to the physical demands of field work, including weather resistance, battery life, and ergonomic considerations that don't typically factor into office-based AR applications.

Perhaps most critically, our research highlighted the fundamental challenge of identifying use cases where Apple Vision Pro offers genuine advantages over existing mobile devices like iPads or iPhones. While the spatial computing capabilities are impressive, many of our initial concepts could theoretically be achieved through conventional mobile interfaces or AR applications on smartphones. The key differentiator emerged in scenarios requiring true hands-free operation in hazardous environments, precise spatial annotation of physical infrastructure, and collaborative experiences where multiple users need to share the same augmented view of complex 3D data. The question "Why is Apple Vision Pro the best device to solve this problem?" became our north star, pushing us to focus on use cases where spatial computing isn't just novel, but demonstrably superior to traditional mobile solutions.
