**Client:** Xero

**Partner:** Telstra Purple

**Role:** Managing UX Design Consultant


## Context
---
<br>

**The Challenge**

Xero had 3.49 million subscribers and A$1.3 billion in annual revenue, but was missing a massive opportunity with 10 million sole traders who found traditional accounting software too complex and irrelevant. Designing for the Gig Economy

**The Problem**

The research revealed that sole traders felt accounting was unnecessarily complex and didn't relate to how they ran their businesses. They needed simple business admin tools, not accounting lessons.

**Project Scope**

The team designed Xero Go, a native mobile app for Android and iOS targeting sole traders in UK and Australian markets, leading a distributed team during COVID-19 lockdowns.

## Outcome
---
<br>

Successfully launched in the UK market (September 2022) with positive reception, expanding Xero's addressable market to 2.5 million sole traders. The app enabled users to claim expenses, send invoices, submit tax returns, and track performance without learning traditional accounting principles.

## Key Stages
---
<br>

**Research & Strategy**

I led comprehensive research identifying core user needs: expense claims, invoicing, tax preparation, and performance tracking. My team analyzed gig economy behaviors across platforms to inform our design strategy.

**Design System Development**

I navigated complex challenges with 5+ different system references to create a unified design system for both platforms, establishing shared tokens, components, and clear handoff processes.

**Cross-Platform Design**

I personally addressed Android fragmentation across Samsung OneUI, Huawei Harmony OS, and Google Pixel, adapting Material Design while maintaining Xero's brand consistency and ensuring feature parity across platforms.

**Workflow & Testing**

Drawing on my seven years at Telstra Purple, I established remote collaboration processes using Figma, Slack, and Zoom. I led extensive usability testing with Mixpanel analytics validation, iterating based on user feedback and deferring non-essential features.

## Final Design
---
<br>

The solution delivered streamlined invoicing, expense tracking, income management, performance dashboard, contact management, and Stripe payment integration. My design philosophy prioritized simplicity over accounting jargon, platform-native experiences, mobile optimization, and accessibility across device configurations.

## Key Learnings
---
<br>

**Process:** Creating unified design systems improved efficiency despite initial complexity. Remote collaboration required structured workflows and clear expectations.

**Technical:** Android fragmentation demanded careful UI implementation planning. Large projects need structured file organization from the start.

**Strategic:** Moving from MVP to Minimum Lovable Product thinking created more competitive solutions. Solving real user problems trumped feature completeness.

**Leadership:** My experience managing constant team changes reinforced the importance of clear role definitions, stakeholder alignment, and comprehensive documentation for smooth collaboration.
