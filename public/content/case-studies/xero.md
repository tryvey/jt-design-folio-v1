# Xero Go App: Designing for the Gig Economy

_A native mobile app for sole traders and small businesses_

## Context

**The Challenge**  Xero, a cloud-based accounting software company with A$1.3b in annual recurring revenue, identified a significant market opportunity in the sole trader segment. Despite serving 3.49 million subscribers across major markets, Xero was missing out on the 10 million sole traders in their target markets who found traditional accounting software too complex and irrelevant to their needs.

**The Problem**

-   Sole traders felt accounting was complex and not relevant to their business
-   They prioritized running their business over learning accounting principles
-   Existing processes were often messy, redundant, and unorganized
-   The market needed a simple solution for basic business admin tasks

**Project Scope**  Design and develop Xero Go, a native mobile app for Android and iOS targeting sole traders in the UK and Australia markets. The project involved a distributed team working remotely during COVID-19 lockdowns.

## Outcome

**Business Impact**

-   Successfully launched Xero Go in the UK market (September 2022)
-   Captured positive user feedback and market reception
-   Positioned Xero to compete in the DIY accounting space against existing competitors
-   Expanded Xero's addressable market by targeting the 2.5 million sole traders in their focus regions

**User Impact**

-   Enabled sole traders to complete essential business tasks: claim expenses, send invoices, submit tax returns, and track business performance
-   Simplified accounting processes without requiring users to learn traditional accounting principles
-   Provided a professional solution for the gig economy workforce

## Key Stages

### 1. Research & Strategy

-   Conducted design research on sole trader needs and pain points
-   Identified core "Jobs to be Done": expense claims, invoicing, tax preparation, performance tracking
-   Analyzed the gig economy market and user behaviors across different platforms

### 2. Design System Development

-   Navigated complex design system challenges with 5+ different system references
-   Created a unified design system for both Android and iOS platforms
-   Developed shared design tokens, components, and implementation guidelines
-   Established clear handoff processes between design and development teams

### 3. Cross-Platform Design

-   Addressed Android fragmentation across multiple vendors (Samsung OneUI, Huawei Harmony OS, Google Pixel)
-   Adapted Material Design principles while maintaining Xero brand consistency
-   Handled different screen resolutions and vendor-specific customizations
-   Ensured feature parity between iOS and Android platforms

### 4. Workflow Optimization

-   Established remote collaboration processes using Figma, Slack, and Zoom
-   Implemented design feedback sessions and co-design workshops
-   Created comprehensive handover documentation including Android Studio setup guides
-   Developed scalable file structures to handle large design systems

### 5. Testing & Iteration

-   Conducted extensive usability testing throughout the development cycle
-   Used Mixpanel analytics to validate design decisions with real user data
-   Iterated based on both qualitative user feedback and quantitative behavioral data
-   Refined features based on testing results, deferring non-essential features like "Healthy Habits"

## Final Design

**Core Features Delivered:**

-   **Invoicing & Subscriptions**: Streamlined invoice creation and management
-   **Expense Tracking**: Simple expense claim and categorization
-   **Income Management**: Revenue tracking and reporting
-   **Dashboard**: Clear overview of business performance
-   **Contact Management**: Client and vendor organization
-   **Payment Integration**: Stripe payment processing
-   **Settings & Feedback**: User customization and Intercom integration

**Design Principles:**

-   **Simplicity First**: Eliminated accounting jargon and complex workflows
-   **Platform Native**: Respected iOS and Android design conventions while maintaining brand consistency
-   **Mobile-Optimized**: Designed specifically for phone interfaces with plans for tablet expansion
-   **Accessible**: Ensured usability across different Android vendors and device configurations

## Learnings

### Process Learnings

-   **Design System Unity**: Creating a single design system for both platforms significantly improved efficiency and consistency, despite initial complexity
-   **Remote Collaboration**: Clear expectations and structured workflows are crucial for distributed teams, especially during uncertain times like COVID-19
-   **Iterative Validation**: Continuous testing and data analysis prevented costly feature development that didn't serve user needs

### Technical Learnings

-   **Android Complexity**: Android's vendor fragmentation requires careful consideration of different UI implementations and testing across multiple devices
-   **File Management**: Large design projects need structured file organization from the start to prevent Figma crashes and confusion
-   **Cross-Platform Parity**: Maintaining feature consistency across platforms while respecting native conventions requires careful planning

### Strategic Learnings

-   **MLP vs MVP**: Moving from Minimum Viable Product to Minimum Lovable Product thinking helped create a more competitive and user-friendly solution
-   **Market Pivots**: Flexibility in target markets (AU to UK) requires robust localization planning and quick adaptation capabilities
-   **User-Centric Focus**: Solving real user problems (simplifying accounting for sole traders) trumps feature completeness in early releases

### Team Learnings

-   **Change Management**: Constant team changes require clear role definitions and knowledge transfer processes
-   **Stakeholder Alignment**: Regular communication between product and UX teams prevents scope creep and maintains vision clarity
-   **Documentation**: Comprehensive handover guides and design specifications are essential for smooth development collaboration
