**Summary**  

*Xero Go was designed to give sole traders simple, jargon-free tools for expenses, invoicing, tax, and performance tracking—opening up a new market of 2.5 million users for Xero. Our team delivered the cross-platform UX strategy, design system, and remote collaboration that made the app a success.*

## Context
---
<br>


**The Challenge**

Xero had 3.49 million subscribers and A$1.3 billion in annual revenue, but was missing a massive opportunity with 10 million sole traders who found traditional accounting software too complex and irrelevant. Designing for the Gig Economy

**The Problem**

The research revealed that sole traders felt accounting was unnecessarily complex and didn't relate to how they ran their businesses. They needed simple business admin tools, not accounting lessons.

**Project Scope**

The team designed Xero Go, a native mobile app for Android and iOS targeting sole traders in UK and Australian markets, leading a distributed team during COVID-19 lockdowns.

Successfully launched in the UK market (September 2022) with positive reception, expanding Xero's addressable market to 2.5 million sole traders. The app enabled users to claim expenses, send invoices, submit tax returns, and track performance without learning traditional accounting principles.

## Key Stages
---
<br>

**Research & Strategy**

The team conducted comprehensive research identifying core user needs: expense claims, invoicing, tax preparation, and performance tracking. My team analyzed gig economy behaviors across platforms to inform our design strategy.

**Design System Development**

I navigated complex challenges with 5+ different system references to contribute to the unified design system for both platforms, establishing shared tokens, components, and clear handoff processes.

**Cross-Platform Design**

I tackled the challenges of designing for multiple platforms, balancing native guidelines with Xero’s brand identity to deliver a consistent experience and feature sets across devices.

**Workflow & Testing**

I established remote collaboration processes using Figma, Slack, and Zoom. I led extensive usability testing with analytics validation, iterating based on user feedback and deferring non-essential features.

## Final Design
---
<br>

The solution delivered streamlined invoicing, expense tracking, income management, performance dashboard, contact management, and Stripe payment integration. My design philosophy prioritized simplicity over accounting jargon, platform-native experiences, mobile optimization, and accessibility across device configurations.

## Key Learnings
---
<br>

**Process:** Creating unified design systems improved efficiency despite initial complexity. Remote collaboration required structured workflows and clear expectations.

**Technical:** Android fragmentation demanded careful UI implementation planning. Large projects need structured file organization from the start.

**Strategic:** Moving from MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to MLP (Minimum Lovable Product) thinking created more competitive solutions. Solving real user problems trumped feature completeness.

**Leadership:** My experience managing constant team changes reinforced the importance of clear role definitions, stakeholder alignment, and comprehensive documentation for smooth collaboration.
