Marvel Stadium launched a comprehensive redesign of their companion app to fundamentally elevate the fan experience across every touchpoint of their venue journey. This digital transformation aligned closely with the stadiumâ€™s ambitious $225 million precinct upgrade, creating a cohesive ecosystem that bridges physical and digital experiences. The app serves as a central hub for ticketing, parking reservations, venue navigation, and immersive engagement features including live streaming, fan cam photography, dynamic promotional content, and streamlined food ordering capabilities. Leading this project, I guided my team through the complex challenge of delivering a reliable, cross-platform solution that would not only delight fans but also drive operational efficiency for venue partners and vendors.

### Outcome

<br>

In my role as Managing Consultant, I guided the design team to achieve substantial improvements that transformed both the app's performance architecture and core functionality. I coached the team through developing enhanced platform capabilities that now facilitate seamless car park booking experiences, sophisticated opt-in marketing communication systems, and integrated radio streaming capabilities alongside elevated fan engagement features. We delivered technical improvements across both iOS and Android platforms, with particular focus on mentoring the team to optimize performance on smaller devices while establishing a robust, scalable codebase that positions the app for long-term growth and feature expansion.
  

### Key Stages
---
<br>

**User & Stakeholder Research** Our team conducted extensive engagement across multiple user groups, with collaborative efforts to conduct in-depth interviews with frequent stadium attendees, operations staff, and marketing teams. Together, we thoroughly validated existing pain points and aligned our understanding with core business objectives. Through this comprehensive research phase, we established clear feature prioritization criteria and ensured our design decisions were grounded in real user needs and operational requirements. I provided mentoring and coaching support throughout the process to help guide our collective efforts toward these shared goals.

**Feature Prioritisation & Scoping** Drawing directly from our research insights, we strategically focused our efforts on enhancing system reliability and building user confidence around critical functions such as car park booking experiences, overall app responsiveness, and transparent communication preferences. This collaborative scoping exercise involved the entire team working through the careful balance between ambitious feature requests and practical implementation constraints, ensuring we could deliver meaningful impact within project timelines.

**Design Iteration & Collaboration** We fostered a design process that emphasized close collaboration between design and development teams throughout each iteration cycle. Our designers worked seamlessly with developers in crafting intuitive user flows while proactively troubleshooting platform-specific technical limitations, ensuring we maintained visual and functional consistency across both iOS and Android implementations without compromising the user experience or technical performance.

**Testing & Validation** Together, we implemented a rigorous testing methodology that included both prototype validation and early release testing conducted in authentic stadium environments. Our team managed the closed user group, which included stadium staff and regular attendees, extracting invaluable feedback on real-world performance scenarios and practical usability considerations that informed our final design refinements.
  
### Final Design

**Unified Dashboard** The app opens to a comprehensive dashboard that serves as the central command center for the entire stadium experience, presenting upcoming events, parking access management, and curated fan experiences in an intuitive, scannable format that allows users to quickly access their most relevant information.

**Plan Your Visit** We designed streamlined booking flows that encompass transport coordination, parking reservations, detailed stadium mapping, and comprehensive accessibility features, creating a cohesive pre-visit planning experience that reduces uncertainty and builds anticipation for the event.

**Bookings & Tickets** The ticketing system features secure car park reservations with locally cached QR codes and integrated payment receipts, ensuring users maintain access to their bookings even in areas with poor connectivity, such as underground parking structures.

**Opt-In Preferences** We developed a transparent, user-friendly interface for marketing consent management that allows granular control over email and SMS communications, with clear visual indicators and easy modification options that build trust through transparency.

**Fan Cam & Radio** Live audio streaming and event-day Fan Cam functionality are seamlessly integrated into the app experience, providing immersive engagement opportunities that connect users to the excitement and community atmosphere of live events.

**Security Layer** Optional biometric authentication provides robust security while maintaining user convenience through touch-free access where device capabilities support it, creating a frictionless yet secure entry point to personal account information.

**Responsive UI** Our responsive design system ensures fluid layouts across device sizes with particular attention to smaller screens, featuring thoughtfully adapted interactive elements and optimized user flows that maintain consistency and usability across both platform ecosystems.

### Learnings
