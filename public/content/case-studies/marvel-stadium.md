### Project Overview

**Project:** Marvel Stadium App Design

**Client:** Marvel Stadium / AFL

**Partner:** Telstra Purple

**Role:** Managing UX Design Consultant

Marvel Stadium launched a redesigned companion app to elevate the fan experience before, during, and after events through seamless UX and tech innovation. Closely integrated with the venue’s $225M precinct upgrades, the app enhances ticketing, parking bookings, navigation, and in-venue engagement with features like real-time streaming, fan cam photography, dynamic promotions, and a digital food ordering system—streamlining the experience for fans while improving operational efficiency for vendors. The goal was to create a reliable, cross-platform digital companion that enriches every aspect of the stadium visit.

### Outcome
We delivered a significant improvements that elevated both performance and functionality. The enhancements enabled smoother car park bookings, opt-in marketing communications, and radio integration, and fan engagement features. Across platforms, we also improved performance on small devices and strengthened the codebase for long-term scalability.
  

### Key Stages

-   **User & Stakeholder Research:** We engaged frequent stadium attendees, operations staff, and marketing teams to validate pain points and business goals. This informed which features to prioritise.
    
-   **Feature Prioritisation & Scoping:** Using research insights, we focused on improving reliability and user confidence around car park bookings, app responsiveness, and communication opt-ins.
    
-   **Design Iteration & Collaboration:** Collaborated closely with developers to design seamless flows and troubleshoot platform-specific limitations without compromising consistency.
    
-   **Testing & Validation:** Prototypes and early releases were tested in real-world scenarios by a closed group of users, including stadium staff, to ensure performance and ease of use.
  
### Final Design
-   **Unified Dashboard**: Entry point presenting upcoming events, parking access, and fan experiences.
    
-   **Plan Your Visit**: Booking flows for transport, parking, stadium maps, and accessibility features.
    
-   **Bookings & Tickets**: Secure car park reservations with cached QR codes and payment receipts.
    
-   **Opt‑In Preferences**: Clear, user‑friendly UI for marketing consent selections (email, SMS).
    
-   **Fan Cam & Radio**: Access to live audio streams and event day Fan-Cam directly in app.
    
-   **Security Layer**: Optional biometric login for touch‑free authentication where supported.
    
-   **Responsive UI**: Fluid layouts designed for small screens, with thoughtful adaptation of interactive elements and flows across both platforms.

### Learnings
- **Cross‑Platform UX Consistency**: Designing features once and delivering them seamlessly across iOS and Android avoids duplication and reinforces brand coherence.
    
- **Offline Resilience**: Local caching of QR codes was essential—connectivity in underground carparks is unreliable, yet access bookings must remain available.
    
- **Granular Consent Drives Trust**: Allowing marketing opt‑in choices fosters user trust; keeping the preferences visible and easily changeable strengthens transparency.
    
- **Balancing Security & Flow**: Biometric authentication provided strong user protection without friction—especially appreciated on Android where device ecosystems vary.
    
- **Feature Prioritization via User Journeys**: Car park booking, radio streaming, and fan cam emerged as high‑value core flows, which were prioritized in development and UX testing.
    
- **Aligning with Place & Brand**: Features like Stadium Radio and Fan Cam tied directly to the essence of Marvel Stadium as a high‑tech, fan‑centric venue, reflecting broader precinct redevelopment goals
