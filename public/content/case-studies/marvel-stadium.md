### Project Overview

**Project:** Marvel Stadium App Design

**Client:** Marvel Stadium / AFL

**Partner:** Telstra Purple

**Role:** Managing UX Design Consultant

### Context
App design for a digital food ordering system, streamlining the in-venue experience for fans and improving operational efficiency for vendors.

Marvel Stadium, one of Australia’s premier sports and entertainment venues, required a digital solution that would streamline visitor experiences—before, during, and after events. The mobile app aimed to enhance ticketing, parking, venue navigation, and engagement via seamless UX and tech innovation. Our goal was to evolve the app into a reliable digital companion for stadium goers, while keeping the experience cohesive across platforms.

### Outcome
We delivered a significant improvements that elevated both performance and functionality. The enhancements enabled smoother car park bookings, opt-in marketing communications, and radio integration, laying the groundwork for future fan engagement features. Across platforms, we also improved performance on small devices and strengthened the codebase for long-term scalability.
  

### Key Stages

-   **User & Stakeholder Research:** We engaged frequent stadium attendees, operations staff, and marketing teams to validate pain points and business goals. This informed which features to prioritise.
    
-   **Feature Prioritisation & Scoping:** Using research insights, we focused on improving reliability and user confidence around car park bookings, app responsiveness, and communication opt-ins.
    
-   **Design Iteration & Collaboration:** Collaborated closely with developers to design seamless flows and troubleshoot platform-specific limitations without compromising consistency.
    
-   **Testing & Validation:** Prototypes and early releases were tested in real-world scenarios by a closed group of users, including stadium staff, to ensure performance and ease of use.
  
### Final Design
-   **Marketing Opt-In Communications:** A redesigned, user-friendly consent process was added to allow fans to subscribe to personalised updates—improving engagement while ensuring compliance with privacy expectations.
    
-   **Streamlined Car Park Booking:** Users can now book parking anonymously, with improved payment flows and QR code caching for offline entry—optimising for speed and reducing potential friction.
    
-   **Radio Integration (PoC):** A proof of concept for streaming live radio content was built into the app, laying the foundation for future integrations like match commentary or real-time event updates.
    
-   **Performance & Codebase Improvements:** The app now performs more reliably on small screens, loads faster, and has removed outdated AR code, reducing bloat. Enhancements to biometric authentication further reinforced security and convenience.

### Learnings and next steps
-   **Designing for Performance Is UX:** Many UX wins were achieved not through UI changes, but by improving load times, streamlining flows, and removing unused features—reminding us that experience includes everything under the hood.
    
-   **Cross-Team Collaboration Matters:** Close cooperation with engineering helped us ship scalable features, especially for sensitive flows like payments and biometric authentication.
    
-   **Proof of Concept Can Drive Vision:** The radio PoC, though not fully launched, helped stakeholders visualise future potential and align on roadmap priorities.
    
-   **Respect for User Privacy Is Key:** Our opt-in communication flow had to balance marketing goals with a frictionless, trustworthy user experience—reaffirming the importance of ethical design.
