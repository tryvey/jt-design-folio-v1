### Context

Telstra Purple was engaged to conduct a discovery project aimed at improving the end-to-end delivery process for Telstra products through Australia Post. The challenge involved a complex supply chain with multiple stakeholders including Telstra, Australia Post, StarTrack, and Toll, where customers experienced frustrations with tracking, delivery failures, address validation issues, and lengthy claims processes.

The project addressed critical business challenges including a DIFOT (Delivery In Full On Time) rate of only 95.6% (below agreed SLA), $1-2M annual losses from damaged goods, fraud detection gaps, and poor customer experience across multiple touchpoints. The discovery aimed to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement across the entire delivery ecosystem.

### Outcome

The 3-week discovery phase successfully identified and prioritized key improvement opportunities across five critical areas:

-   **Claims Process Reform**: Streamlined dispute resolution and consolidated information pipelines
-   **DIFOT Process Enhancement**: Improved forecasting, transparency, and reporting mechanisms
-   **Address Validation Optimization**: Standardized address databases and early validation processes
-   **Digital Airlock Security Upgrade**: Enhanced 4-digit verification system for secure deliveries
-   **Damage Prevention**: Real-time tracking and touch-point mapping to reduce $1-2M annual losses

The project provided clear recommendations for quick wins and strategic improvements, with validated pain points from all stakeholders and prioritized solutions based on financial impact, reputational risk, and implementation complexity.

### Key Stages

**Stage 1: Stakeholder Discovery (Week 1)**

-   Conducted separate discovery workshops with Australia Post and Telstra teams
-   Mapped current workflows from each organization's perspective
-   Captured pain points specific to each stakeholder group
-   Identified key personnel and process touchpoints

**Stage 2: Joint Analysis (Week 2)**

-   Facilitated combined workshop with both Telstra and Australia Post teams
-   Synthesized workflows into unified end-to-end process map
-   Validated pain points across organizational boundaries
-   Identified opportunities for cross-functional improvements

**Stage 3: Synthesis & Prioritization (Week 3)**

-   Analyzed findings and highlighted critical gaps in service delivery
-   Prioritized opportunities based on business impact and feasibility
-   Developed recommendations for immediate and long-term improvements
-   Created roadmap for future solution development phases

### Final Design

The discovery culminated in a comprehensive opportunity framework with five priority areas:

**Immediate Quick Wins:**

-   Claims process review and consolidation
-   DIFOT process mapping and transparency improvements
-   Digital Airlock security enhancements (4-digit verification fix)

**Strategic Improvements:**

-   Address validation standardization using shared databases
-   Real-time damage prevention through improved tracking
-   Customer notification enhancement across all touchpoints
-   Contract driver compliance improvements
-   Fraud prevention automation

**Process Improvements Identified:**

-   Unified tracking system across StarTrack and Australia Post
-   Improved scanning processes and chain of custody clarity
-   Enhanced customer communication and preference management
-   Streamlined returns and reconsignment processes

### Learnings

**Human-Centered Design Insights:**

-   Multi-stakeholder ecosystems require separate discovery sessions before joint collaboration
-   Pain points often exist at organizational handoff points, not within individual processes
-   Customer experience is directly impacted by internal operational inefficiencies

**Process Design Discoveries:**

-   5% of tracking events fail to transfer between systems, creating customer confusion
-   Manual address entry leads to delivery failures that could be prevented with better validation
-   Security processes (Digital Airlock) created customer friction without proportional risk reduction

**Strategic UX Learnings:**

-   Complex B2B2C relationships require careful orchestration of multiple user journeys
-   Data quality issues upstream cascade into poor customer experiences downstream
-   Small operational improvements (like 4-digit verification) can have significant customer satisfaction impacts

**Methodology Insights:**

-   Workshop pivoting from challenge statements to deep pain point exploration yielded richer insights
-   Separate stakeholder sessions prevented organizational bias from limiting problem identification
-   Visual workflow mapping was essential for identifying cross-organizational friction points

-   The discovery phase successfully set the foundation for future design and prototyping work, with clear priorities and validated opportunities for improving the customer delivery experience.
