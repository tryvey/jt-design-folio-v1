Design system development and digital transformation for Open Universities Australia.

### Project Overview
- Ollie Design System
- Open University
- 3 Months
- Jamie Treyvaud â€“ Managing Consultant & Senior Consultant


### Purpose
Open Universities approached Telstra Purple to collaborate and execute a design system as a valuable tool moving forward.

### The Opportunity
Open Universities wanted to develop a design system to improve collaboration, efficiency, and the overall quality of their portfolio and brand. With multiple products being developed in parallel, speed of delivery was impacted by factors like specialist availability, communication issues, or lack of clarity around standards.

### Success
A unified set of design standards, components, and guidelines was delivered, ensuring a consistent user experience across all products and platforms, and enabling faster, more scalable development.
