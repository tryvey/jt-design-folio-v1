*Ollie Design System: Bento-style overview of Design System key benefits.*

### Context
---
Open Universities Australia (OUA) engaged Telstra Purple to define, design, and implement a scalable Design System that would unify their digital experiences and improve collaboration across cross-functional teams. The goal was to establish a robust and future-ready design foundation to support OUA’s digital transformation and ensure consistency across their growing suite of products and services.

### Outcome
---
A unified set of design standards, components, and guidelines was delivered, ensuring a consistent user experience across all products and platforms, and enabling faster, more scalable development.

The resulting Design System has become a cornerstone of OUA’s digital capability, reducing design and development effort, improving quality and accessibility, and enabling faster delivery of consistent user experiences.
  

### Key Stages

*Design tokens enable consistent, scalable theming by linking core design decisions—like colour, typography, and spacing—to reusable variables, making it easier to update and maintain visual styles across components and platforms.*

- Working closely with stakeholders across design, development, and marketing.

- Audited existing design and UI patterns to identify inconsistencies and areas for consolidation

- Defined a shared visual language, accessibility standards, and component architecture aligned with OUA’s brand and user needs

- Implemented a fully integrated Dark Mode in Figma, ensuring components, color tokens, and accessibility guidelines seamlessly adapted to enhance usability and visual consistency across the design system.

*DarkMode - Components built with linked light and dark variants can seamlessly switch themes by dragging them into frames with corresponding color styles, instantly updating their appearance to match the frame’s mode.*



- Built a comprehensive library of reusable components in Figma and partnered with engineering to align on implementation in code (e.g. React, Storybook)

- Developed governance models and contribution guidelines to ensure long-term scalability and adoption across teams

- Delivered supporting documentation, onboarding materials, and training workshops to empower internal teams

  
### Final Design
---
The Ollie Design System delivered a robust and scalable foundation of reusable UI components, patterns, and documentation—all built in Figma and engineered for seamless implementation. The system embodies OUA’s brand, accessibility standards, and product requirements, enabling teams to move faster with confidence. Designed with flexibility in mind, the system supports modular design across multiple products while maintaining a cohesive user experience. Collaborative tooling, clear usage guidelines, and component consistency have empowered OUA’s teams to create accessible, high-quality digital experiences with less friction and greater alignment.

### Learnings and next steps
---
A “test as you go” approach to design systems ensures that components are continuously validated in real-world contexts as they are created, rather than after the fact. By integrating testing—across usability, accessibility, and technical implementation—into the design and build workflow, teams can catch issues early, reduce rework, and build greater confidence in the system’s quality and consistency. This iterative method also encourages feedback loops between designers, developers, and end users, helping the system evolve based on actual needs rather than assumptions. Ultimately, it leads to more resilient, user-centered components and a design system that is both trusted and adopted across teams.
