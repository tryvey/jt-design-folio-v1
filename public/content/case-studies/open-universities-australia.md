### Overview
---

**Project:** Design System Implementation

**Client:** Open Universities Australia (OUA)

**Partner:** Telstra Purple

**Role:** Managing UX Design Consultant


### Context
---
Open Universities Australia (OUA) engaged Telstra Purple to define, design, and implement a scalable Design System that would unify their digital experiences and improve collaboration across cross-functional teams. The goal was to establish a robust and future-ready design foundation to support OUA’s digital transformation and ensure consistency across their growing suite of products and services.

### Outcome
---
A unified set of design standards, components, and guidelines was delivered, ensuring a consistent user experience across all products and platforms, and enabling faster, more scalable development.

The resulting Design System has become a cornerstone of OUA’s digital capability, reducing design and development effort, improving quality and accessibility, and enabling faster delivery of consistent user experiences.
  

### Key Stages
---

Working closely with stakeholders across design, development, and marketing, we:

-   Audited existing design and UI patterns to identify inconsistencies and areas for consolidation
    
-   Defined a shared visual language, accessibility standards, and component architecture aligned with OUA’s brand and user needs
    
-   Built a comprehensive library of reusable components in Figma and partnered with engineering to align on implementation in code (e.g. React, Storybook)
    
-   Developed governance models and contribution guidelines to ensure long-term scalability and adoption across teams
    
-   Delivered supporting documentation, onboarding materials, and training workshops to empower internal teams

### Learnings and next steps
---
A “test as you go” approach to design systems ensures that components are continuously validated in real-world contexts as they are created, rather than after the fact. By integrating testing—across usability, accessibility, and technical implementation—into the design and build workflow, teams can catch issues early, reduce rework, and build greater confidence in the system’s quality and consistency. This iterative method also encourages feedback loops between designers, developers, and end users, helping the system evolve based on actual needs rather than assumptions. Ultimately, it leads to more resilient, user-centered components and a design system that is both trusted and adopted across teams.

Component development for New Home Page, Marketplace, Student Hub, and SelectionX. Continue developing and refining components to support other areas within the Open Universities ecosystem.
