*Ollie Design System: Bento-style overview of Design System key benefits.*

### Context
---
When Open Universities Australia approached us at Telstra Purple, they were facing a challenge many of our enterprise clients experience—fragmented digital experiences across their growing product ecosystem. Their teams were working in silos, creating inconsistent user interfaces and duplicating effort. As their Managing UX consultant, I knew we needed to establish a comprehensive Design System that would not only unify their visual language but fundamentally transform how their cross-functional teams collaborate. This wasn't just about creating pretty components; it was about building the digital infrastructure that would scale with OUA's future growth plans.

### Outcome
---
What we delivered was far more than a component library—we created **Ollie**, a living Design System that has fundamentally changed how OUA builds digital products. The impact has been remarkable: development velocity has improved, design consistency is now maintained across all touchpoints, and most importantly, their users enjoy a cohesive experience regardless of which OUA product they're using. The system has become the single source of truth that bridges the gap between design intention and technical implementation, something I've seen transform organisations throughout my seven years at Purple.
  

### Key Stages

*Design tokens became our strategic foundation—these atomic design decisions around colour, typography, and spacing created the DNA that would ensure consistency at scale. I always tell clients that tokens are the secret sauce that makes everything else possible.*


- In my experience leading design system initiatives, success hinges on getting the foundational architecture right from the start. We began with extensive stakeholder alignment across design, development, and marketing teams—because a design system is only as strong as the buy-in it receives.


- Our comprehensive audit of existing UI patterns revealed what I suspected: significant inconsistencies that were creating friction for both users and internal teams. We catalogued every component, interaction pattern, and visual treatment to understand the full scope of consolidation needed.

- The visual language and component architecture we established wasn't just about aesthetics; it was carefully aligned with OUA's brand values and user research insights. We embedded accessibility as a core principle from day one, not as an afterthought.


- One of our most innovative achievements was implementing a fully integrated Dark Mode system in Figma. This wasn't just about creating dark variants—we built an intelligent system where components automatically adapt their appearance based on their context.

**The Dark Mode implementation exemplifies smart system thinking—designers can simply drag components between light and dark frames, and the components intelligently update their appearance. This level of automation reduces errors and speeds up design workflows considerably.**

- Our partnership with the engineering team was crucial. We didn't just hand over designs; we collaborated closely to ensure seamless implementation in their React and Storybook environment. This collaborative approach, which I've refined over my years at Purple, prevents the all-too-common disconnect between design and development.

- Finally, we established robust governance models and contribution guidelines. A design system without proper governance is just an expensive component library—it needs structure to remain valuable long-term.

  
### Final Design
---
- Ollie represents everything I believe a modern design system should be: comprehensive yet flexible, rigorous yet approachable. Built in Figma with engineering-ready specifications, it embodies OUA's brand while maintaining the modularity needed for their diverse product portfolio.

- What I'm particularly proud of is how we've empowered OUA's teams. The clear documentation, intuitive tooling, and comprehensive onboarding materials mean that new team members can contribute meaningfully from day one. This democratisation of design quality is what makes a design system truly successful—it's not just used by designers, but embraced by the entire product organisation.

### Learnings and next steps
---
- Throughout my career at Purple, I've learned that the most successful design systems are those that embrace continuous validation. Our "test as you go" methodology has proven invaluable—rather than building in isolation and hoping for adoption, we validate each component in real contexts as we create it.

- This approach creates powerful feedback loops between our design, development, and user research streams. Issues are caught early, reducing expensive rework and building confidence in the system's quality. More importantly, it ensures the system evolves based on actual user needs rather than theoretical requirements.

- Moving forward, I recommend OUA continues this iterative approach, treating Ollie as a living product that grows with their organisation. The foundation we've built together is strong, but the real magic happens when teams start contributing back to the system, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement and innovation.

- This collaborative, evidence-based approach to design systems is what I've seen work consistently across my Purple engagements—it creates systems that aren't just adopted, but genuinely loved by the teams that use them.
